            <h1>Welcome to My Portfolio</h1>
            <p>Hi! I’m John Felmer B. Robles, a 3rd year Computer Science student at West Visayas State University with a background in Computer System Servicing (CSS). <br> I enjoy working on both hardware and software — from setting up servers and troubleshooting systems to coding projects in Java, Python, and web technologies.  <br> I’m passionate about learning, problem-solving, and building tech solutions that make a difference.</p>

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi! I’m John Felmer B. Robles — I started my tech journey back in senior high school where I took up Computer System Servicing (CSS). That’s where I first learned how to assemble PCs, troubleshoot hardware, and set up networks. Right now, I’m a 3rd year Computer Science student at West Visayas State University, diving deeper into programming, software development, and problem-solving.

        I love tinkering with systems, exploring how things work behind the scenes, and building solutions that make life easier. Whether it’s coding a project, setting up a server, or figuring out a tricky bug, I enjoy the challenge of turning problems into opportunities to learn.</p>

        <h2>Experience</h2>
        <p>One of my most exciting experiences was setting up a Windows Server from scratch — configuring domains, managing users, and handling file-sharing and security settings. I’ve also worked on small-scale LAN configurations, system troubleshooting, and academic projects that involve both coding and system design.

        Each project I take on pushes me to learn more and improve, and I’m excited to keep growing in this field.</p>
